# AES Encrypted Data Transmission Between Arduino (ESP32) and C# (ASP.NET)

This project presents a demo on the implementation of an AES-encrypted HTTP request carried between an Arduino (ESP32) device and C# ASP.NET.

This Arduino project uses the following library:
- "AESLib" provided by Matej Sychra
- "base64_encode" provided by dojyorin
